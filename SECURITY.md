3. Will provide appropriate acknowledgment to the discoverer (with their consent)

## Third-Party Components

The portfolio uses various third-party libraries and frameworks. Security vulnerabilities in these components should be reported directly to their respective projects, unless the implementation in the portfolio itself is causing the issue.
