## How to Add Your Images

### Method 1: Direct AI Drive Integration
If your images are accessible via web URLs from AI Drive:

1. Open `/assets/js/gallery-images-config.js`
2. Add your images to the appropriate category arrays:

```javascript
'world-environments': [
    {
        src: 'https://your-ai-drive-url/image1.jpg',
        title: 'Your Image Title',
        description: 'Brief description of the image'
    },
    // Add more images...
]
```

### Method 2: Local Storage
If you need to copy images to the website:

1. Create a folder: `/assets/images/ai-gallery/`
2. Create subfolders for each category:
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/world-environments/`
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/fantasy-settings/`
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/scifi-settings/`
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/characters-models/`
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/horror-settings/`
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/nsfw-horror/`
   - `/assets/images/ai-gallery/nsfw-erotic/`

3. Copy your images to the appropriate folders
4. Update the configuration file with relative paths:

```javascript
'world-environments': [
    {
        src: 'assets/images/ai-gallery/world-environments/image1.jpg',
        title: 'Your Image Title',
        description: 'Brief description of the image'
    }
]
```

## Image Optimization Recommendations

### Image Formats
- **JPEG**: Best for photographs and complex scenes
- **WebP**: Modern format with better compression (if supported)
- **PNG**: For images requiring transparency

### Recommended Sizes
- **Thumbnail/Grid View**: 800x600px or 1024x768px
- **Full View (Lightbox)**: 1920x1080px or 2560x1440px
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for grid, 2MB for full view

### Image Processing Tips
1. **Compression**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
2. **Lazy Loading**: Already implemented in the gallery
3. **Progressive JPEG**: Enable for better perceived loading

## Important Disclaimer (English)

All AI-generated images displayed in this gallery are entirely fictional creations born from imagination and advanced prompt engineering. These artworks have been generated using various AI models and techniques, and they bear **no connection whatsoever to real persons, places, situations, or events**.

Every image is a product of creative exploration in the realm of artificial intelligence art generation. Any resemblance to actual persons (living or deceased), real locations, or actual events is purely coincidental and unintentional.

Beyond the artwork showcased here, I have also created more intense and grotesque content in genres such as extreme horror and dark fantasy. If you are working on projects that require such specialized content—whether for games, films, animations, trailers, conceptual art, or other creative endeavors—I am available for commissioned work and collaborations.

For professional inquiries regarding custom AI-generated artwork for your creative projects, please feel free to contact me through the contact section.
